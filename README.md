# Hey! Listen!
### This project is *super old* and is on Github mainly for entertainment value.

This is a prototype I made of the v2 of [PatternTap](http://patterntap.com), back when it was still owned by [Matthew Smith](http://twitter.com/whale). Responsive web design had just arrived on the scene and Matthew and I brainstormed about ways to make things scale down to the iPhone. I settled on a 320px grid, which seemed to work pretty ok.

This project was also the one in which I wrote my shitty little Python script that serves and compiles Django (well, Jinja2, but whatevs) template files. A janky replacement for [Tintype](http://github.com/meyer/archives--tintype/). This is also my one and only experiment with HAML. Sheesh. What a hunk of junk.
